		<h1>What is War on Drugs?</h1>
		<p> Since taking office on June 30, 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has waged a "war on drugs" that has killed over 12,000 Filipinos, the majority of whom are urban poor.
	    The Philippine National Police has been blamed for at least 2,555 of the fatalities. 
			In a campaign that arguably amount to crimes against humanity, Duterte and other senior officials have provoked and incited the killings.
      Police are manipulating evidence to justify unlawful killings, according to Human Rights Watch Research. 
			Despite mounting calls for an investigation, Duterte has pledged to press on with his campaign. </p>
