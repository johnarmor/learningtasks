	     <h1> Solutions/Actions to the Problem </title>
	      <h2> The Philippines has a large drug population and a thriving drug trade. 
              However, almost two years into the government's anti-drug effort, there is no evidence that the exclusive concentration on enforcement-led and punitive policies is effective. 
              It's also likely that tough-on-crime enforcement is squeezing out more sustainable and effective approaches to drug recovery, such as health- and community-based initiatives. </h2>
