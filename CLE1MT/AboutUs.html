		<h1> What is the purpose of having solutions of War on Drugs </h1>
		<p> One of the purposes of preventing the War on Drugs in the Philippines is the respect for life.  Many died, including children, because of this war.  
		We have to remember that life is sacred and precious and only God can take it back. Another is due process. An accused has to be subjected to due process before conviction. 
		The war War on Drugs does not consider due process. The suspect is immediately killed, which affects the image of the justice system of the country.</p>
