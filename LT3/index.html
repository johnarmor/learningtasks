			 <p> Kare-kare is a Philippine stew (kare derives from "curry") that features a thick savory peanut sauce.

		   <div> Crispy Pata<center><img src="crispypata.jpg">
			 <p> Crispy pata is a Filipino dish consisting of deep fried pig trotters or knuckles served with a soy-vinegar dip. It can be served as party fare or an everyday dish. Many restaurants serve boneless pata as a specialty. </p> </center> </div>
		   <div> Bulalo<center><img src="bulalo.jpg">
			 <p> The perfect company for a cool, rainy day in the Philippines is a nice hot bowl of bulalo. This tasty soup is made by slow-cooking beef shanks and bone marrow (still in the bone) in some water with fish sauce, onions, and peppercorn, and later adding in some vegetables. Especially known for this dish is the province of Batangas in the country’s Southern Luzon region.</p></center></div>
		   <div>Pork Barbecue<center><img src="barbecue.jpg">
			 <p>A merienda (snack in between meals) favourite in the Philippines is Pinoy pork barbecue. While this skewered sweet meat goes wonderfully well with the ubiquitous plain rice during meals, there’s also nothing like catching yourself hungry in the middle of the afternoon and conveniently walking down the street over to the vendors grilling them road-side for only PHP15 ($0.30) a stick. </p></center> </div>
